## Portfolio

#### Hi, my name is Bart≈Çomiej.

I am a forthcoming Junior Data Analyst and I love learn about how to things work also love physical exercises like running üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è right after intellectual exercise üìö. For the past few years I worked as a chef where I learned how important is attention to details, analyzing situations and making quick informed decisions.
Over time I realized that the world around us constantly generates data, and working with it has the power to shape the reality we live in. This inspired me to change my career path and start my journey into data analytics ;).


#### My skillset includes a diverse range of tools and technologies, such as:

- üêç **Python** data analysis and automation
- üóÑÔ∏è **SQL** querying, processing data
- üìä **Excel** preparation, cleanup, manipulation and visualization
- üìà **Power BI** for creating interactive and insightful dashboards

I leverage these tools to uncover patterns, extract meaningful insights, and drive data-driven decision-making.

## My Latest Projects:

### [Medical Personal Cost (Excel)](https://github.com/BartlomiejIT/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Analysis%20of%20Medical%20Personal%20Cost%20(Excel))

As a person who cares about my health, I decided to check what is behind and influences the costs associated with using healthcare. Is there a specific age range in which the price increase is drastically high and what could be the reason for this? What solutions related to insurance prices could motivate customers to change their habits and take advantage of more favorable offers for them. To analyze this topic, I have prepared a Dashboard that can help understand the relationships between BMI Groups, Age, Smoking Status or Number of Children and Costs for Medical Services.

### [Analysis of Top Influencers Campaign (Excel-SQL-Power BI)](https://github.com/BartlomiejIT/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Analysis%20Top%20Influencers%20Campaign%20(Excel%20-%20SQL%20-%20Power%20BI))

I chose this topic because I was interested in how cooperation with influencers looks like in terms of advertising campaigns. What the process of selecting specific solutions looks like in terms of return on investment. Cooperating with influencers who have less followers can be more profitable than working with more recognizable individuals. What could I propose the most optimal solutions for stakeholders? To answer this questions and analyze I combined work with Excel, SQL and Power BI to obtain satisfactory results and present data on an interactive dashboard.

### [Analysis of the World Happiness Report 2024 (Python)](https://github.com/BartlomiejIT/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/World%20Happiness%20Report%202024%20(Python))

](https://github.com/BartlomiejIT/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/World%20Happiness%20Report%202024%20(Python))

The project was born out of my curiosity about how and what makes certain parts of the world more happy than others. Are there other factors besides economics that contribute to this? Which countries have seen the biggest increases and decreases in happiness over time? Working with Python and libraries like matplotlib and geopandas has broadened my visualization skills and has been a practical exercise in using the pandas library.

### [Analytical Practice and Optimization Queries Spotify (SQL)](https://github.com/BartlomiejIT/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Analytical%20Practice%20and%20Optimization%20Queries%20Spotify%20Dataset%20(SQL))

[![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c888044a-d7be-4305-be83-ea7104e5742f)](https://github.com/BartlomiejIT/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Analytical%20Practice%20and%20Optimization%20Queries%20Spotify%20Dataset%20(SQL))

This time I focused on technical practice in data exploration, query creation, and performance optimization using SQL. It allowed me to develop advanced query-writing skills while progressing through from basic to advanced levels of complexity. The data derived from the queries were designed to be further use for visualization with tools like Power BI or Tableau.
