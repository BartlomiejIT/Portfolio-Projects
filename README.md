#### Hi, my name is Bart≈Çomiej.

I am a forthcoming Data Analyst and I love learn about how to things work also love physical exercises like running üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è right after intellectual exercise üìö. For the past few years I worked as a chef where I learned how important is attention to details, analyzing situations and making quick informed decisions.
Over time I realized that the world around us constantly generates data, and working with it has the power to shape the reality we live in. This inspired me to change my career path and start my journey into data analytics.


#### My skillset includes a diverse range of tools and technologies like:

- üêç **Python**: statistical analysis, work with large amount of datasets and data prcoessing automation  
  
- üóÑÔ∏è **SQL**: querying, optimization, processing and analyze data
  
- üìä **Excel**: preparation, formatting, cleanup, manipulation and data visualization
  
- üìà **Power BI**: creating interactive and insightful dashboards

I use these tools to discover patterns, draw valuable insights, and support data-driven decisions.

## My Latest Projects:

### [Medical Personal Costs in the U.S. (Excel) end-to-end](https://github.com/BartlomiejIT/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Analysis%20of%20Medical%20Personal%20Cost%20(Excel))

](https://github.com/BartlomiejIT/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Analysis%20of%20Medical%20Personal%20Cost%20(Excel))

- As a person who cares about health, I decided to check what is behind and influences the costs associated with using healthcare. I was curious if is there a specific age range in which the price increase is drastically high and what could be the reason for this? What solutions related to insurance prices could motivate customers to change their habits and take advantage of more favorable offers for them. To analyze this topic, I have prepared a Dashboard that can help understand the relationships between BMI Groups, Age, Smoking Status, Number of Children and Costs for Medical Services.

### [Analysis of Top Influencers Campaign (Excel-SQL-Power BI) end-to-end](https://github.com/BartlomiejIT/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Analysis%20Top%20Influencers%20Campaign%20(Excel%20-%20SQL%20-%20Power%20BI))

- This time I checked how cooperation with influencers looks like in terms of advertising campaigns. What the process of selecting specific solutions looks like in terms of **Return on Investment**. Cooperating with influencers who have less followers can be more profitable than working with more recognizable individuals. What could I propose the most optimal solutions for stakeholders? To analyze and answer these questions I combined work with Excel, SQL and Power BI to obtain satisfactory results and present data on an interactive dashboard.

### [Analysis of the World Happiness Report 2024 (Python) end-to-end](https://github.com/BartlomiejIT/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/World%20Happiness%20Report%202024%20(Python))

](https://github.com/BartlomiejIT/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/World%20Happiness%20Report%202024%20(Python))

- The project was born out of my curiosity about how and what makes certain parts of the world more happy than others. Are there other factors besides economics that contribute to this? Which countries have seen the biggest increases and decreases in happiness over time? Working with Python and libraries like Matplotlib and Geopandas has broadened my visualization skills and has been a practical exercise in using the Pandas library.

### [Data Cleaner Application (Python)](https://github.com/BartlomiejIT/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Data%20Cleaner%20Application%20(Python))

- I have prepared very useful application that cleans data by handling duplicates, missing values ‚Äã‚Äãand then returns our cleaned data set. The application also keeps a backup of duplicate rows, replaces missing values ‚Äã‚Äãwith a calculated average (mean) values and removes missing non-numeric values. This tool is dedicated for data analysts and data scientists, which will make easier and speed up our process of working with data.

### [Analysis Coffee Company Market Potential in India (SQL-Power BI)](https://github.com/BartlomiejIT/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Analysis%20Coffee%20Company%20Market%20Potential%20in%20India)

[![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82ca46b2-b32d-4afa-9cbf-cba6e4839f15)](https://github.com/BartlomiejIT/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Analysis%20Coffee%20Company%20Market%20Potential%20in%20India)

- As a one of the coffee consumer, I decided delve into the topic about a year-old company developing in the Indian coffee market. Especially the issue of opening new points of coffee shops through analysis and selection of the most optimal locations based on sales profits, rental costs, population of potential consumers and the current number of customers. To analyze and obtain the three best options to open new sales points, I used tools such as PostgreSQL with extensive database queries and Power BI to visualize my results.
