## Portfolio

#### Hi, my name is Bart≈Çomiej.

I am a forthcoming Junior Data Analyst and I love learn about how to things work also love physical exercises like running üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è right after intellectual exercise üìö. For the past few years I worked as a chef where I learned how important is attention to details, analyzing situations and making quick informed decisions.
Over time I realized that the world around us constantly generates data, and working with it has the power to shape the reality we live in. This inspired me to change my career path and start my journey into data analytics ;).


#### My skillset includes a diverse range of tools and technologies, such as:

- üêç **Python** data analysis and automation
- üóÑÔ∏è **SQL** querying, processing data
- üìä **Excel** preparation, cleanup, manipulation and visualization
- üìà **Power BI** for creating interactive and insightful dashboards

I leverage these tools to uncover patterns, extract meaningful insights, and drive data-driven decision-making.

The project was inspired by my interest in understanding the financial drivers behind personal healthcare costs. By using Excel, I prepared and analyzed a dataset to explore how variables such as age, BMI, and smoking habits affect medical expenses. Visualizations helped highlight patterns between these factors and overall costs.
Also working on this project helped me improve my skills with using Microsoft Excel's tools.

### [Analysis of Top Influencers Campaign (Excel-SQL-Power BI)](https://github.com/BartlomiejIT/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Analysis%20Top%20Influencers%20Campaign%20(Excel%20-%20SQL%20-%20Power%20BI))

This project was created cause of my curiosity about influencer marketing to increase ROI. I combined Excel data preparation, SQL processing, analysis and Power BI dashboards to evaluate an influencer campaign including influencers like Zendaya or Kendall Jenner. By analyzing audience engagement and profitability, I identified the most impactful strategies and made actionable recommendations for future campaigns.
Through this project I extended my knowledge of how influencer marketing works and what makes campaigns successful. It gave me value insights into the interplay between audience behavior, engagement metrics, and financial outcomes, which are crucial for decision-making in modern marketing.

This analysis was motivated by my desire to understand the factors contributing to global happiness. With Python, I analyzed data from the World Happiness 2024 Report, focusing on some factors like GDP per capita, social support or life expectancy. 
Working on this project helped me better understand how social and economic factors influence our well being. It also introduced me to the side of geographic and socioeconomic data, providing a wider perspective on global differences and opportunities for improving happiness.
