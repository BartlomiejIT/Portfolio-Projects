Hi, my name is Bart≈Çomiej.

I am a Junior Data Analyst with passion for solving real problems with data.
For the past few years I have worked as a chef, where I have learned how important details, analysis and making quick decisions are.
Over time, I have discovered that my curiosity about numbers and processes can take me to a completely new reailty - the world of data.
I decided to change my career path and started a new journey towards data analytics.
Today, I combine my experience with a practical approach to data, creating visualizations and reports that help make better decisions.
